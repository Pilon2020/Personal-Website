The redesigned ENVE Aero Stem faceplate was analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA) to assess structural integrity under typical cycling loads.

- **Max Principal Stress:**  
  23.2 MPa in simulation, well below the 75.11 MPa from hand calcs.

- **Displacement:**  
  Simulation displacement was -1.49 × 10⁻⁷ m compared to 0.0003526 m in hand calcs.

This discrepancy reflects the difference in modeling fidelity: the simulation considers complex geometry and loading more accurately. Mesh convergence was achieved at 736,575 DoF. High-stress regions were partitioned for better resolution without sacrificing performance.

Future refinements could include modeling fastener threads and simulating dynamic loading conditions to more closely replicate real-world use.
