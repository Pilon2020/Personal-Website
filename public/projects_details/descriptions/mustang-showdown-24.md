At the end of the season in April of 2024, the Cal Poly Triathlon coach, Coach Scott Machado, approached me to see if I would be interested in hosting a new race at Cal Poly in the fall. The race as described by Coach Scott and some of the other coaches was going to be a series of super short races, held over the course of one morning.

After each race the racers would be resorted into new heats, so the races would get more competetive and faster as the day progressed. Somewhat similar to the Super Leagues style of racing where each triathlete does a munch of super sprints over the course of the day. I accepted the challenge and got to work. Working through throughout the summer I was able to host the race on October 13th, 2024. With 54 registrants the race was a little smaller than I would have liked from a business perspective, as we were unable to make money from the event, but it was nice having a smaller field as we ran into quite a few problems on race day that were considerably more easy to solve since we had so few people racing.
