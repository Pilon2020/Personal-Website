This class project for a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course focused on redesigning the [ENVE Aero Stem](https://enve.com/products/aero-stem?variant=45111154376988) to work with standard 30mm clip-on aerobars, such as the [Zipp Vuka Clip](https://www.sram.com/en/zipp/models/hb-vkal-clpe-a1).

With flat aero handlebars becoming more popular, the goal was to offer cyclists a simple solution that didn’t require replacing their entire cockpit. This idea was sparked when a teammate struggled to find a compatible setup before an Ironman and ultimately raced without aerobars.

The project began by replicating the ENVE faceplate in Fusion 360, ensuring seamless compatibility. The design was then extended to support clip-on aerobars with minimal modification. Using Abaqus for FEA, rider weight and aero loading were simulated to validate the design.

Although loads were simplified for the course context, special attention was paid to mesh convergence — achieving ~736,000 degrees of freedom while keeping run times manageable.
