I have been slowly reworking my personal website, so this is the first update since I have set up the new format for larger longer projects, that will have more continuous updates. This project has been a much slower process for me than I initially anticipated. Other than being a way larger project than I probably should have taken on for the first time I am working with databases and webscraping, a lot of the data analysis and data processing have required me to learn a lot of data processing skills which I had not anticipated.

To bring everything up to speed on here there is a lot of go over, but not a lot of good images to help explain everything since I have been reworking a lot as I go, and have recently decided to need to rework even more to get it to do the analysis I want. So I will just give a brief overview of the project, where I am so far, and what other features am I hoping to add.

### The Idea

There are many sites that already kinda do what I want to do with my site which I have tentitively called All-Results, though I am likely to change the name if I can come up with something better. There are a few sites that I am using as inpiration: <ins>[EnduranceData](https://www.endurance-data.com/en/)</ins>, <ins>[Athlinks](https://www.athlinks.com/)</ins>, <ins>[Athletic.net](https://www.athletic.net/athlete/8803981/track-and-field/)</ins>, and <ins>[Road-Results](https://www.road-results.com/racer/296108)</ins>. The idea is to combine all of them to create a more powerful one stop shop kind of website which can help provide analysis of each race, an overview of each athlete, and just provide interesting data on athletes over time. <ins>[EnduranceData](https://www.endurance-data.com/en/)</ins> is not longer updating, so the last race analysis on there is from a few years ago, and other than that I haven't been able to find a website that provides analysis of races. <ins>[Athlinks](https://www.athlinks.com/)</ins> is nice as it provides many if not all race results, but I want athlete profiles like those provided on <ins>[Athletic.net](https://www.athletic.net/athlete/8803981/track-and-field/)</ins> and <ins>[Road-Results](https://www.road-results.com/racer/296108)</ins>, which are not currently a thing for triathletes.

### So Far

To start as simple as possible I have started with the results for the <ins>[WCCTC](https://www.wcctc.com/)</ins>, the collegiate triathlon conference I am in. I can easily get the results and can verify them becuase I am in many of the races, I started with the races that I participated in during my collegiate triathlon season, as well as a few races in the area that are common for me and my team to participate in. So far I have implamented:

* Athlete Result Compiler - Right now since there are so few people, it is quite easy to make a basic profile for each person, and sort races into unique names. As race results are uploaded, the individual athletes are sorted and if that person already exsits they are added to that profile (I know that will lead to issues once I expand this to more results, but for the time being it is working)
    * Each unique result is loaded in and stored in a collection in the larger database, with a unique ID, when a racer is identified for that result, that unique ID is added to the racers profile.
    * When viewing a racers profile, the results associated with that racer are all querried, showing a list of all races that person has participated in, sorted by the year and distance of each event. Additionally, the race dates and distances are used to determine the racers Personal Records (PR) and Season Records (SR) for each year and over their lifetime. 
* Basic Athlete Stats - On a seperate tab on the racers page, is the racers stats. these are more conglomerate stats about the athlete. 
    * Average finish times are displayed for each distance, year and overall.
    * Like on  <ins>[Road-Results](https://www.road-results.com/racer/296108)<ins> racers nemesis, victims, top finishes, etc. are on this tab too.
* Basic Athlete Analysis - Taking a lot of insipration from <ins>[Road-Results](https://www.road-results.com/racer//296108)<ins>, and has a few plots of times and speeds through time, based on the race results. 

### Future Features

ELO System, Athlete score wheel, race analyis for each athlete, general race stats, improved racer sorting.
