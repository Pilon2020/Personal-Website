Unfortunately I have just now updated my website to be more productive for actively tracking updates on my projects, especilly my big ones. So unfortunately there are not many updates on this while it still is my thesis, and progres will be slow for the next few months while I finish my thesis and start in the work force. 

All this post is the basic update that I had on my old website. Unfortunately I have not linked the old project on it just yet.


This project aims to address the critical and long-standing need for effective respiratory protection for wildland firefighters, as current options, such as N95 masks and bandanas, fall far short of offering adequate defense against the harmful smoke, toxic materials, and gases they are exposed to on the job. Wildland firefighters, who regularly endure long shifts in extreme environments, face significantly higher risks of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other serious health conditions. A mortality study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) has demonstrated that career firefighters have notably higher rates of cancer-related deaths compared to the general population, further underscoring the urgency of providing reliable respiratory protection. Unfortunately, previous efforts to design respirators for wildland firefighting have been unsuccessful in meeting the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1984 standards or withstanding the physical demands of wildland firefighting conditions, which include high heat, rough terrain, and long durations of use. Through the collaboration between the Wildfire Conservancy, the WUI Fire Institute at Cal Poly, and CAL FIRE, a team of students, myself included, came together to design an an innovative air-respirator designed to provide continuous airflow while effectively filtering out harmful particulates and gases. This new device aims to bridge the gap between safety and practicality, ensuring that it not only meets strict safety standards but is also durable, comfortable, and capable of withstanding the rigors of wildland firefighting. Although the team made a lot of progress we were unable to reach a final product that we felt happy with and were confident that would meet the NFPA standards and would protect the firefighters as was our goal.
