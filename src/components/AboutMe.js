                My engineering background, combining biomedical and mechanical disciplines, has equipped me with hands-on experience in areas like SolidWorks, 
                Python, MATLAB, and 3D printing. During my time at Cal Poly, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in problem-solving, design, and teamwork, with a focus on creating 
                innovative and practical solutions. My passion for engineering extends into my leadership in projects like designing a Wildland Fire Respirator, and a bespoke 
                handlebar for a bike. These experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate in cross-functional teams and tackle complex challenges. 
                I am particularly driven to apply my skills toward impactful solutions, bridging engineering and public health to improve quality of life.
