    date: 'Sept 15, 2024',
    description: `One common problem I have been running into while doing indoor rides on my trainer I am just far enough away from the table that I cannot reach things
    like my phone or the tv remote. Companies like Wahoo have a solution for this with products like the
    <a href="https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/indoor-cycling/accessories/kickr-desk-buy" target="_blank"> Kickr Desk</a>
    , which I personally do not want to pay $200 for; and is probably overkill in terms of size for most of what I need to store on it during a workout. I have seen a few products
    That are a little similar to this product, but all cost close to the same as the Kickr Desk. This lead me to wanting to make something that could be manufactured quickly
    and cheaply, and could be adjusted as needed based on the users requirements.`,
    features: `Using 3d printing to create the angled mount and the platform allowed for the product to be manufactured more cheaply, and quickly than alternative methods. Using a 
    non-slip silicon mat holds devices or anything else on the table even while being covered in sweat and water during a workout. The silicon mat is also easily removable to 
    clean it. `,
